## CHUNK 1: Why Nutrition Matters at Long Distances

**Context:** This explains the physiological reason nutrition strategy is critical for half marathons and marathons but not for 5K/10K races.

- The body stores ~500g of glycogen (stored carbohydrate)
- This provides enough energy for 60–90 minutes of running at 55–75% max heart rate
- After glycogen depletes, the body shifts to fat — a much slower energy conversion
- This shift is called "hitting the wall" — sustaining pace becomes nearly impossible
- For 5K/10K races, glycogen depletion is not a concern (race ends before stores empty)
- For half marathons (especially 90+ min finishers) and all marathons, managing glycogen is the central challenge
- Three-part solution: (1) fill glycogen stores before the race via carb loading, (2) consume carbs during the race, (3) hydrate properly to enable absorption

## CHUNK 2: Planning Timeline

**Context:** How far in advance to begin nutrition planning, by distance.

- **Marathon:** Start nutrition planning at least 10 weeks before race day
  - Need time to identify which products your stomach tolerates
  - Need to practice full fueling plan during long training runs
  - Need to train the gut to absorb carbohydrates during exercise
- **Half marathon:** 4–6 weeks of practice is typically sufficient
- **The #1 rule across all sources:** Never experiment with new nutrition on race day
  - Every gel, drink, chew, and bar should be tested multiple times in training
- **Source:** Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks

## CHUNK 3: Daily Macronutrient Targets During Training

**Context:** Daily nutritional targets during the training phase. Applies equally to half marathon and marathon training.

- **Carbohydrates:** 5–8g per kg body weight per day
  - Primary fuel source for endurance running
- **Protein:** 1.4–1.8g per kg body weight per day
  - Supports muscle repair, recovery, injury prevention
  - Consume throughout the day and always after a run
- **Fat:** ~30% of total calories
  - Backup energy, vitamin absorption, cell health
  - Can increase if needed to meet caloric demands
- **Total calories:** Athletes training 2–3 hrs/day, 5–6 days/week may need 2,000–7,000 cal/day (depending on 50–100kg body weight range)
  - Meet with 3 meals + multiple snacks
  - Choose nutrient-dense food over junk food

## CHUNK 4: Meal Timing Around Training Runs

**Context:** When and what to eat relative to training sessions. Applies to both half marathon and marathon training.

- **2–3 hours before a run:**
  - Balanced meal: carbs + moderate protein + some healthy fat
  - Examples: oatmeal with banana and peanut butter; whole-grain toast with avocado and egg
- **30–60 minutes before (if short on time):**
  - Light carb snack: banana, handful of raisins, small smoothie
  - Choose something easy to digest
- **During runs lasting longer than 1 hour:**
  - Energy gels, sports drinks, dried fruit, energy bars
  - Sip water regularly; add electrolytes in hot conditions
  - This is when to practice race-day fueling
- **Within 30–60 minutes after a run:**
  - Carbs + protein to replenish glycogen and repair muscle
  - Examples: chicken with quinoa and roasted vegetables; Greek yogurt smoothie with berries and spinach
  - If unable to eat a full meal, use a protein bar or recovery drink

## CHUNK 5: Gut Training

**Context:** Why and how to train your digestive system to handle race-day nutrition.

- Your gut is extremely trainable — regular carb intake during exercise improves tolerance and absorption
- Runners who don't practice race fueling in training are significantly more likely to have GI problems on race day
- Runners on low-carb or high-fat diets who don't regularly consume carbs during exercise will have diminished absorption capacity
- **How to train your gut:**
  - Find out what products are at your race's aid stations
  - Practice with those specific products during long training runs
  - If they cause GI problems, find alternatives weeks in advance
  - Build up gradually to your full race-day fueling plan
  - Start at least 10 weeks before a marathon, 4–6 weeks before a half marathon

## CHUNK 6: Carb Loading — Half Marathon (PRE-RACE)

**Context:** How to load glycogen stores before a half marathon.

- **Duration:** Moderate loading over 1 day (the day before the race)
- **Approach:** A few extra carb-rich meals; not a dramatic overhaul
- **Biggest carb meal:** Breakfast the day before (not dinner)
- **Night-before dinner:** Carb-centered, slightly larger than usual — satisfied, not stuffed
- **Dinner examples:**
  - Lean burger + sweet potato fries
  - Grilled salmon + rice + bread
  - Pasta with tomato sauce and garlic bread
- **Avoid:** High-fiber, high-fat, adventurous or unfamiliar foods
- **GI-prone runners:** Reduce fiber intake the day before
- **Source:** MOTTIV; Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks

---

## CHUNK 7: Carb Loading — Marathon (PRE-RACE)

**Context:** How to load glycogen stores before a marathon. Significantly more involved than half marathon loading.

- **Duration:** Spread over 2–3 days before the race, across multiple meals
- **Approach:** Increase the proportion of daily calories from carbohydrates — NOT just eat more food overall
  - Shift calories away from fat toward carbs
  - Swap usual foods for carb-rich alternatives (e.g., afternoon fruit → slices of toast; side salad → potatoes or rice)
- **Biggest carb meal:** Breakfast the day before the race
- **Last large meal:** At lunchtime the day before — lighter dinner in the evening to prevent bloating and sleep disruption
  - Lighter dinner example: sweet potato with soup and bread
- **Night-before dinner examples:**
  - Pasta with tomato sauce and garlic bread
  - Chicken or fish with potatoes/noodles/rice and side salad
  - Normal-sized plate of pasta and meatballs
- **Fiber:** Reduce to minimum 1–2 days before if GI-prone
- **Old-school extreme protocols** (depletion runs + zero carb days + gorging) are unnecessary — simply eating more carbs achieves very high glycogen levels
- **Travel tip:** Make a dinner reservation in advance at a trusted restaurant; don't scramble last-minute

## CHUNK 8: Race Morning Breakfast (PRE-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** What to eat on race morning for half marathon or marathon.

- **Why it matters:** Breakfast replenishes liver glycogen, which the brain depletes overnight. Low liver glycogen = earlier bonk.
- **Timing:** 3–4 hours before start (2–3 hours if no GI history)
- **Carb target:**
  - Marathon: at least 100g of carbohydrates
  - Half marathon: carb-centered and easily digestible (flexible target)
- **Composition:** High carb, low fiber, low fat, low protein
- **Breakfast examples:**
  - Bagels with peanut/almond butter and banana
  - Porridge/oatmeal with banana, honey, nuts
  - White toast with peanut butter
  - Pancakes with fruit and honey
  - Energy bars + coffee
  - Small bowl of rice
- **Hydration:** Check urine color — should be light. If dark, keep sipping water or electrolyte drink.
- **Coffee/tea drinkers:** Follow normal routine; warm beverages help stimulate GI system
- **If too nervous to eat full breakfast:** Don't worry too much — if you carb-loaded properly in prior days, it won't make a huge difference

## CHUNK 9: Final 5–20 Minutes Before Start (PRE-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** Last-minute fueling just before the gun.

- **What to take:** 1 energy gel + a few sips of water
- **Half marathon:** Caffeinated gel recommended for energy/alertness boost
- **Marathon:** Regular or caffeinated gel
- **Key principle:** Anything consumed in the minutes before the start takes time to absorb and becomes available during the race — count this toward your during-race carb intake, not separate from it
- **Also:** Bring a water bottle to sip while waiting in the corral
- **Source:** Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks; HIGH5; MOTTIV

## CHUNK 10: During-Race Carbohydrate Targets — Half Marathon (IN-RACE)

**Context:** How many grams of carbs per hour to consume during a half marathon.

- **Target:** 30–60g carbohydrate per hour
  - 2hr+ runners: lower to middle end of range
  - Sub-1:30 runners: higher end of range
- **When to start:** Within the first 30–40 minutes — don't wait until you feel tired
- **Frequency:** Take nutrition every 30–40 minutes
- **Max absorption:** Body can handle 60–90g/hr maximum; exceeding this causes GI distress
- **Consumption tip:** Take gels over 4–5 minutes, not all at once — slower intake aids absorption
- **Source:** McGregor via Runner's World UK; HIGH5; Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks

---

## CHUNK 11: During-Race Carbohydrate Targets — Marathon (IN-RACE)

**Context:** How many grams of carbs per hour to consume during a marathon.

- **First 3 hours:** 30–60g carbohydrate per hour
- **After 3 hours:** Increase to 60–90g per hour as glycogen drops further
- **Pacing considerations:**
  - 4–5 hour finishers: lower end of range
  - 3-hour finishers: higher end of range
- **When to start:** Within the first 30 minutes
- **Frequency:** Every 20–40 minutes
- **Dose-response relationship:** Studies show more carbs generally = better performance, up to the point of GI distress. Push toward the upper end of your tested tolerance.
- **Consumption tip:** Take gels over 4–5 minutes, not all at once
- **Max absorption:** 60–90g/hr — the body's ceiling

## CHUNK 12: Carbohydrate Sources for During-Race Fueling (IN-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** Common mid-race fuel options and their carb content.

- Energy gel: 21–27g per gel
- Energy bar: 20–40g per bar
- Banana: 24–30g per banana
- 4–5 energy chews: 16–25g
- 10 jelly beans: ~11g
- Sports drink (1 serving): 20–30g
- **Mix and match** sources to hit your hourly target
- **If using on-course sports drinks:** Account for their carb content when calculating gel intake
- **Avoid during race:** High-fiber, high-fat, high-protein foods
- **Only use products tested in training**
- **Source:** Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks; HIGH5

---

## CHUNK 13: Gel Timing Schedule — Half Marathon by Finish Time (IN-RACE)

**Context:** Specific gel schedules for half marathon runners, organized by goal finish time. Assumes 1 caffeinated gel taken 10–15 min before start as baseline.

- **Sub-1:15 half marathon:**
  - 1 caffeinated gel at ~45 min mark
- **Sub-1:45 half marathon:**
  - 1 caffeinated gel at ~45 min
  - 1 additional gel at ~75 min
- **2-hour-plus half marathon:**
  - Start gels at 40 min
  - Then 1 gel every 30 min throughout the remainder
- **Practical tip:** Set a watch alarm or write reminders on your hand — race atmosphere is distracting
- **Source:** HIGH5

---

## CHUNK 14: Gel Timing Schedule — Marathon by Experience Level (IN-RACE)

**Context:** Specific gel schedules for marathon runners, organized by experience level.

- **Novice marathon runners:**
  - 1 gel every 20–30 min
  - Alternate between caffeinated and non-caffeinated gels
- **Experienced marathon runners:**
  - 1 gel every 20 min
  - Alternate between caffeinated and non-caffeinated gels
- **Adjustment:** If 3 gels per hour feels overwhelming, reduce to what is comfortable — goal is sustained energy without stomach distress
- **Always practice** this schedule during training long runs before race day
- **Set a watch alarm** as a reminder
- **Source:** HIGH5

## CHUNK 15: Caffeine Strategy (IN-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** How to use caffeine during half marathon and marathon racing.

- **How caffeine helps:** Reduces perception of effort, improves alertness/concentration, may reduce mental fatigue impact
- **Effective dose:** 3mg per kg body weight (e.g., 200mg for a 70kg runner)
- **Max daily intake:** 400mg from all sources
- **Caffeine content of common products:**
  - Caffeinated gel: 25–50mg per gel
  - Espresso: 80–100mg
- **Timing by distance:**
  - Half marathon: use caffeine from the pre-start gel onward (race is short enough to benefit throughout)
  - Marathon: most effective in the second half, when perception of effort is highest and mental fatigue is accumulating
- **Implementation:** Alternate caffeinated and non-caffeinated gels, or save caffeinated gels for the second half
- **Individual variation:** Works for most but may cause negative effects for some. Always test in training.
- **Contraindications:** Do not use if you have high blood pressure, are pregnant, breastfeeding, or under 18

## CHUNK 16: Pre-Race Hydration (PRE-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** How to hydrate in the hours and day before the race.

- **24 hours before:** Start drinking electrolytes
- **3 hours before:** Sip ~530ml water with an electrolyte tablet
  - Urine should be clear or light-colored by start time
  - If still dark, drink another 400ml water
- **At the start line:** Bring a water bottle to sip while waiting
- **Don't overhydrate:** Goal is light urine, not forcing excessive fluid
- **Applies to both half marathon and marathon**
- **Source:** McGregor via Runner's World UK; Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks

---

## CHUNK 17: During-Race Hydration (IN-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** How much fluid to consume during the race.

- **Sweat rate:** Runners typically sweat 400ml–2,400ml per hour (highly individual)
  - Calculate yours by weighing before/after training runs in race-similar conditions, adding volume of fluid consumed
- **Intake target:** 300–800ml per hour depending on sweat rate, conditions, thirst
- **Stomach capacity:** Can empty ~180–210ml every 15 min (~720–840ml/hr) — this is trainable
- **Aid station cups:** Contain ~150ml; you actually consume ~100ml
- **CRITICAL — Don't overdrink:**
  - Drinking enough to gain weight can cause hyponatremia (dangerously low blood sodium)
  - This is a potentially life-threatening condition
  - Some weight loss at finish (up to 2% body weight) is normal and fine
- **Source:** McGregor via Runner's World UK; Jeukendrup via TrainingPeaks

---

## CHUNK 18: Electrolytes and Sodium (IN-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** Sodium replacement strategy during racing.

- **Why sodium matters:**
  - Lost through sweat and must be replaced
  - Enables carbohydrate absorption in the gut
  - Without adequate sodium, consumed glucose concentrates in the gut and can't be absorbed → stomach upset
- **Sodium in sweat:** 115–2,000+ mg per liter (highly individual)
- **Target intake:** 700–900mg sodium per hour during longer races
- **Sources:** Electrolyte drinks, dissolvable tablets in water, salt capsules, salt sticks
- **By distance:**
  - Half marathon: moderately important (especially for 90+ min runners)
  - Marathon: essential (especially in heat or for 3hr+ runners)
- **Note:** A marathon is generally too short to cause extreme sodium losses threatening health, but sodium significantly supports carb absorption and performance

## CHUNK 19: Troubleshooting Mid-Race Stomach Problems (IN-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** What causes GI distress during racing and how to fix it.

- **Primary cause:** Sodium and hydration imbalance — NOT the gels/bars themselves
- **Mechanism:** When dehydrated and consuming glucose, the glucose becomes highly concentrated in the gut. Blood is being directed to working muscles, so the gut can't absorb glucose fast enough → stomach upset, nausea, cramping
- **If stomach issues arise mid-race:**
  1. Slow your pace
  2. Sip water
  3. Take a salt capsule
  4. Wait and reassess before resuming gel intake
- **Prevention:** Stay on top of hydration AND sodium intake throughout the race. Practice your full fueling plan during training to condition the gut.

---

## CHUNK 20: Post-Race Recovery Nutrition (POST-RACE, Both Distances)

**Context:** What to eat and drink after finishing.

- **Immediately after finishing:**
  - Drink 400ml recovery drink (carbs + electrolytes)
  - Repeat 1–2 hours later
- **Within 30–60 minutes:**
  - Eat a meal combining carbohydrates and protein
  - Carbs replenish glycogen; protein repairs muscle
  - If unable to eat a full meal, use a recovery drink with carbs, protein, vitamins, minerals
- **Throughout the rest of the day:** Continue rehydrating
- **Practical perspective:** Most runners won't race again for weeks. Don't obsess over precise recovery timing. Enjoy your achievement and eat well in moderation.

## CHUNK 23: Top 10 Nutrition Mistakes

**Context:** The most common fueling errors for half marathon and marathon runners.

1. **Not practicing race nutrition in training** — your gut needs training like your legs (Jeukendrup)
2. **Trying new products on race day** — the most repeated advice across all sources
3. **One massive pasta dinner for carb loading** — spread loading over days and meals; one huge dinner causes bloating and sleep disruption (Jeukendrup; MOTTIV)
4. **Skipping race-morning breakfast** — depleted liver glycogen = earlier bonk (Jeukendrup; MOTTIV)
5. **Starting fueling too late during the race** — begin within 30 min, don't wait to feel tired (McGregor; HIGH5)
6. **Overdrinking during the race** — weight gain from excess fluid → hyponatremia risk (Jeukendrup)
7. **Blaming gels for stomach problems** — usually caused by sodium/hydration imbalance, not the gels (McGregor)
8. **Ignoring electrolytes** — sodium enables carb absorption and prevents cramping (McGregor)
9. **Not knowing what's at aid stations** — find out weeks in advance, practice with those products (Jeukendrup)
10. **Under-eating during training phase** — insufficient calories → muscle loss, illness, stress, poor sleep (Abbott; ISSN)
