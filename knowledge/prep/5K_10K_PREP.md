# 5K & 10K Pre-Race & Warmup Guide

> Consolidated guide covering warmup strategies, fueling, stretching, and mental preparation for both 5K and 10K races. The two distances share nearly identical warmup needs — the 10K simply calls for a slightly longer jog, a slightly longer taper, and minor weather-based adjustments.

## Why the 5K and 10K Share a Warmup

Molly Huddle — two-time Olympian and former U.S. record-holder at both 5,000 and 10,000 meters — uses the **exact same warmup for both distances** because their energy demands are similar enough. Coach Jeff, Nogle, and others also treat the two distances interchangeably in their warmup protocols. The only meaningful tweaks for a 10K are noted inline throughout this guide.

## Three Warmup Approaches

### Approach A: Cardiovascular-First / High-RPM

**Best for:** Competitive runners, high school cross country, and advanced athletes chasing PRs.

**Core principle:** Get your heart rate, breathing, and oxygen delivery systems running well above resting levels *before* the gun fires. Starting cold leads to oxygen debt and lactic acid buildup that costs time. *(Benson, Huddle)*

**Sources:** Coach Roy Benson (Runner's World US), Molly Huddle via Scott Douglas (Runner's World UK)

| Time Before Lining Up | Action |
|---|---|
| **Pre-departure** | *(Advanced)* Do part of your pre-run routine at home: foam rolling, dynamic stretching, trigger point work on chronically tight areas (plantar fascia, IT band — 1–2 min per area). *(Huddle)* |
| **45–50 min** | **Warmup run.** Benson: 20-min slow jog. Huddle: 2–3 mile run, starting at a jog and increasing only as natural, finishing near easy-day pace. Both agree: glycogen stores support 10–13 hard miles, so a slow jog won't deplete you. *(Benson, Huddle)* |
| | *(Advanced)* Before the run, do glute/hip activation exercises and dynamic flexibility work (lateral leg swings). *(Huddle)* |
| **25 min** | Benson: logistics window — bathroom, racing flats/spikes, bib, light stretching. Huddle: 3–5 min form drills (A skips, high knees, butt kicks, side skips). |
| **10 min** | **Strides.** Benson: 50–75 yd strides with jog-back recovery, repeated continuously. Huddle: 4 × 30 sec at goal race pace with 1-min walk recovery. |
| **On the line** | Keep moving: jog in place, hop foot-to-foot, bounce, high knees, pogo on toes, partial squats. Never stand still. *(Benson, Huddle)* |

**Key takeaways:**
- Benson: "For a 5K, you can never warm up too much." If short on time, skip stretching and just do strides + movement.
- Huddle: Practice your warmup before interval workouts and tempo runs — you'll learn the timing, build familiarity, and have better workouts.
- The 30-second goal-pace pickups serve double duty: they prime the cardiovascular system *and* lock in the feeling of goal pace so you don't start too fast. *(Huddle)*

**10K tweak:** In hot weather, do a slightly shorter warmup run to conserve energy. In cold weather, maintain or slightly extend it. *(Huddle)*

### Approach B: Structured Progression with Dynamic Focus

**Best for:** Experienced recreational runners who race frequently, runners transitioning from high school to higher-mileage training, and anyone seeking a modern, evidence-based approach that eliminates static stretching.

**Core principle:** Arrive early to remove stress, then progress through deliberate phases — jog, dynamic drills, strides — staying warm and active throughout. Static stretching before racing is outdated and can impair performance. *(Pelerin, Nogle)*

**Sources:** Marc Pelerin (TrainwithMarc), David Nogle (Performance Running Gym)

| Time Before Start | Action |
|---|---|
| **70 min** | *(Pelerin)* Arrive; handle parking, registration, bathroom, course preview. Make this time relaxing and stress-free. |
| **45–65 min** | **Warmup jog.** Pelerin: walk → easy jog → steady (10–50 min depending on fitness and race importance; he personally needs 20+ min to feel "snappy"). Nogle: 6–15 min easy jog with no watch or pace tracking (marathon pace + ~2 min/mile). Beginners: 6–12 min. Experienced: up to 15 min or 2 miles. |
| **After jog** | *(Nogle)* Sign in to race if possible; change into race shoes/spikes. One less thing to worry about near the start. |
| **20–25 min** | **Dynamic warmup.** Active stretching, running drills (A-skips, high knees), progressing from lighter movements to more "running-like" movements. *(Pelerin, Nogle)* |
| **10 min** | Change into race gear. If cold, **layer warm clothes back on** — 10 minutes is long enough to get cold and stiff. Begin periodic strides at race pace. *(Pelerin, Nogle)* |
| **5 min** | Continue strides and active stretching. Rehearse race mantra. *(Pelerin)* |
| **1 min** | Calm nerves; short strides with recovery; lock into race strategy. *(Pelerin)* |

**Key takeaways:**
- Pelerin: Most recreational runners stand motionless at the start line for 30 minutes — effectively using the first 10–15 minutes of their paid race as a warmup.
- Nogle: Don't start strides until 10 minutes before the race. Too many strides at race pace cause unnecessary fatigue.
- Nogle: Don't watch your pace on the warmup jog. Going too fast can psych you out; going too slow can create false sluggishness.
- Nogle: Wear long sleeves during the warmup jog when reasonable.
- Nogle: Static stretching pre-race can weaken muscles and cause strains. Many world-class coaches and athletes have moved away from it entirely. Save static stretching and yoga for *after* the run.

### Approach C: Simple & Repeatable

**Best for:** Beginners, casual 5K/10K runners, injury-prone runners, and anyone who wants a low-barrier protocol that still makes a meaningful difference. Also works well for experienced runners who arrive late or prefer simplicity.

**Core principle:** A streamlined sequence that raises heart rate and prepares muscles without overcomplicating the routine. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV, Coach Jeff)*

**Sources:** Amanda Wendorff (MOTTIV), Coach Jeff (RunnersConnect)

| Time Before Start | Action |
|---|---|
| **40–45 min** | Begin warmup |
| **Step 1: Jog** | MOTTIV: 5–10 min gentle jogging (5K) or 10–15 min (10K). Coach Jeff: 1–3 mile easy run (most runners: 2 miles). Pace doesn't matter — just slow and easy. |
| **Step 2: Stretch/Mobilize** | MOTTIV: dynamic stretching first (leg swings, walking lunges). Coach Jeff: 5–10 min stretching *after* the jog, focusing on sore/tight areas or a general routine for all major groups. |
| **Step 3: Strides** | MOTTIV: 4–6 × 10–15 sec strides building to near peak speed, full recovery between reps. Coach Jeff: 2 × 30 sec strides at slightly faster than goal race pace, with 2–3 min rest between. |

**Key takeaways:**
- Coach Jeff: Many runners skip strides to "save time," but they take only 4–5 minutes and considerably boost performance.
- Coach Jeff: The only race distance you don't need to warm up for is the marathon.
- MOTTIV: The 5K/10K is a near-lactate-threshold effort. Even a short warmup makes a meaningful difference compared to none.

**10K tweak:** Extend the jog by a few minutes (MOTTIV recommends 10–15 min vs. 5–10 for a 5K).

## Why Warming Up Matters

Multiple sources emphasize that the warmup serves three distinct purposes:

**Injury prevention:** Increases blood flow to running-specific muscles, lubricates joints and tendon sheaths, reduces risk of hamstring strains, piriformis issues, and achilles/patellar/posterior tibial tendinitis. *(Coach Jeff)*

**Performance:** Raises core body temperature, speeds oxygen delivery, triggers neural pathways between brain and muscles — improving contraction, power, and efficiency. Without a warmup, the first mile or more is wasted getting into rhythm. *(Coach Jeff, Benson, Huddle)*

**Mental preparation:** An established warmup routine shifts focus from the unknown to something familiar, reducing race-day nervousness. *(Coach Jeff, Pelerin, Huddle)*

## Fueling & Nutrition

### Taper

| | 5K | 10K |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | 3 days before the race | 4–5 days before the race |
| Volume reduction | 40–60% less than normal training | 40–60% less than normal training |
| Workout character | Short, mostly easy, with a few short speed bursts | Short, mostly easy, with a few short speed bursts |

*(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

- Benson adds: with 36–42 hours of reduced training and normal carbohydrate intake, glycogen stores restore fully. Running out of energy in a 5K or 10K is not a concern.
- Test race-day equipment (especially shoes) during taper workouts. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

### Night Before

- **Carb loading is unnecessary** for either a 5K or 10K. Glycogen from daily eating provides enough energy. Overloading carbs causes bloating and discomfort. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Eat a slightly larger dinner** with a solid serving of carbs. Examples: *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
  - Lean burger + sweet potato fries
  - Grilled salmon + rice + bread
  - Normal-sized plate of pasta and meatballs
- Go to bed **satisfied but not stuffed**.

### Race Morning

- **Do not race on an empty stomach.** Eat a small, carb-focused breakfast **3–4 hours before the start**. Examples: *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
  - Bagel with almond butter and banana
  - Small bowl of oatmeal with berries
  - Toast with scrambled egg
- **Hydrate** with a light electrolyte drink (Nuun, Skratch, Precision Hydration) between breakfast and start. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Coffee/tea drinkers:** follow your normal routine. Warm beverages help stimulate the GI system before racing. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

## Stretching Guidance

| Source | Approach | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Benson | Stretching falls in the logistics window; skip it if short on time | Low |
| Pelerin | Active/dynamic stretching + running drills at 20 min before start | Medium-High |
| Wendorff / MOTTIV | Dynamic stretches (leg swings, walking lunges) as the first warmup step | Medium |
| Coach Jeff | 5–10 min stretching after the warmup run, focusing on sore/tight areas | Medium |
| Nogle | Dynamic only before running; static stretching/yoga *after* the run only | High (dynamic) / Avoid (static) |
| Huddle | Dynamic flexibility + foam rolling + activation before the run; form drills after | High |

**Consensus:** Dynamic stretching is universally preferred. Static stretching before a race is either deprioritized or actively discouraged — Nogle cites extensive research showing it can weaken muscles and cause strains. If you foam roll or do activation work, do it *before* the warmup jog *(Huddle)*. If you stretch traditionally, do it *after* the jog when muscles are warm *(Coach Jeff)*.

## Mental Preparation

- **Eliminate logistical stress** by arriving 40–70+ minutes early. Parking, registration, and bathroom lines shouldn't compete with your warmup. *(Pelerin, Benson, Nogle)*
- **Build routine familiarity:** Practice your race warmup before interval workouts and tempo runs so it's second nature on race day. The familiarity reduces nervousness. *(Coach Jeff, Huddle)*
- **Use music or positive self-talk** before the warmup: "you got this," "I'm strong." *(Huddle / Runner's World UK)*
- **Rehearse a race mantra** in the final 5 minutes: "keep calm," "be conservative," "attack the hills." *(Pelerin)*
- **Understand the physiology** of your warmup — knowing you're minimizing oxygen debt and priming your "first wind" builds confidence. *(Benson)*
- **Plan your pacing** and line up among runners targeting a similar finish time. Avoid the "rabbits" at the front. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Start position tip:** Line up on the same side as the first turn on the course, but not at the extreme edge where you could get pinched. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Sign in early** after your warmup jog — one less thing to think about near the start. *(Nogle)*
- **Don't watch your pace** on the warmup jog. Going too fast can psych you out; going too slow can create false sluggishness. *(Nogle)*

## 5K vs. 10K: What Changes

| Factor | 5K | 10K |
|---|---|---|
| Warmup jog length | 5–10 min (Approach C) | 10–15 min (Approach C) |
| Taper duration | 3 days | 4–5 days |
| Hot weather adjustment | Not typically needed | Shorten warmup run slightly *(Huddle)* |
| Cold weather adjustment | Slightly longer warmup run *(Huddle)* | Same |
| Warmup intensity | Same | Same |
| Strides protocol | Same | Same |
| Nutrition approach | Same | Same |
| Race-day urgency | Higher — no time to ease in | Slightly more forgiving, but warmup still critical |

## Universal Takeaways

1. **Any warmup beats no warmup.** Even 10 minutes of strides and movement is vastly better than standing still at the start. *(All sources)*
2. **The 5K and 10K warmup are nearly identical.** The main differences are a slightly longer jog and taper for the 10K. *(Huddle, Nogle, Coach Jeff)*
3. **Strides are the single most critical element** across all approaches — but save them for the final 10 minutes. *(All sources; timing emphasis from Nogle)*
4. **Never stand still on the starting line.** Keep moving until the gun fires. *(Benson, Pelerin, Huddle)*
5. **Dynamic over static stretching.** Pre-race static stretching is an outdated practice that can impair performance. *(Nogle, Huddle, Coach Jeff)*
6. **Glycogen depletion is not a concern** at either distance. Eat normally, skip carb loading, and have a light breakfast race morning. *(Benson, Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
7. **Adjust for weather.** Shorten the warmup run in heat (especially for 10K); maintain or extend it in cold. *(Huddle)*
8. **Practice your warmup in training.** It improves workout quality and builds race-day confidence through familiarity. *(Coach Jeff, Huddle)*
9. **The shorter the race, the more critical the warmup.** Both distances demand high effort from the start, but the 5K is especially unforgiving. *(Benson, Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
