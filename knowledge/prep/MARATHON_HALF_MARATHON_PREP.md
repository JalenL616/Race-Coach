## The Fundamental Shift: Why Long-Race Warmups Are Different

For a 5K or 10K, the universal advice is "warm up as much as possible." For the half marathon and marathon, the calculus changes:

- **Glycogen conservation matters.** A 5K runner has no risk of running out of fuel. A marathoner absolutely does. Every minute of warmup running burns glycogen you'll need later. *(Coach Jeff, Humphrey, Coolsaet)*
- **Race intensity is lower.** A 5K is run near lactate threshold (~95%+ effort). A marathon for most runners is 65–80% VO2max — closer to easy-run intensity. The gap between resting and race pace is smaller, so you need less warmup to bridge it. *(Humphrey)*
- **The race itself can serve as your warmup.** Many coaches recommend using the first 1–2 miles at a controlled pace as your warmup, which also prevents the common mistake of starting too fast. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV, Humphrey, Coolsaet)*

**The key question becomes:** How fast are you running? The faster your goal pace (relative to your fitness), the more warmup you need. A sub-3:00 marathoner racing at 85–90% VO2max needs a very different warmup than a 4:30 marathoner running at 65% VO2max. *(Humphrey)*

## Warmup Approaches by Finish Time

### Approach 1: Minimal / Use-the-Race-as-Warmup

**Best for:** Most first-time half marathoners (2:00+ finish), most first-time marathoners (3:30+), back-of-pack runners, and anyone whose primary goal is to finish rather than race for time.

**Core principle:** Conserve glycogen. Don't jog before the race — let the first mile or two serve as your warmup. Focus on dynamic stretching and staying warm. *(Humphrey, Wendorff / MOTTIV, Coach Jeff)*

**Sources:** Luke Humphrey, Amanda Wendorff (MOTTIV), Coach Jeff (RunnersConnect)

**Half Marathon protocol (2:00+ goal):**
| When | Action |
|---|---|
| Pre-race | Arrive with time for logistics. Wear throwaway warm clothes if cold. |
| 10 min before start | Dynamic stretching routine in your corral: leg swings, walking lunges, ankle rolls (under 5 min, minimal space needed). *(Coach Jeff, Humphrey)* |
| Miles 1–2 of race | Run slightly slower than goal pace. This *is* your warmup. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV, Humphrey)* |

**Marathon protocol (3:30+ goal):**
| When | Action |
|---|---|
| 2.5 hrs before race | Wake up. Short 10-min shakeout run or walk to get blood flowing, stimulate CNS, and help with bathroom. Return to eat breakfast and prepare. *(Coach Jeff)* |
| At starting corral | Stay warm with throwaway clothes (old sweatshirt, cheap thrift store layers, or a trash bag poncho). Staying warm conserves energy. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV)* |
| 10 min before start | Dynamic stretching in corral: lunge matrix, leg swings, ankle rolls, skipping drills. Takes under 5 min, can be done in tight spaces. *(Coach Jeff)* |
| Miles 1–2 of race | Run slightly slower than goal pace. This is your warmup *and* prevents going out too fast. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV, Humphrey)* |

**Key takeaways:**
- Humphrey: "For the 3:30+ marathoner and 2+ hour half marathoner, I wouldn't even worry about jogging. Glycogen conservation is way more important than having warm muscles from the start."
- Coach Jeff: The marathon warmup starts when you wake up. Get up 2.5 hours early — research shows it takes several hours for body temperature to reach optimal levels.
- Coach Jeff: The shakeout run also helps you use the bathroom, which is critical for avoiding GI issues during the race.
- Wendorff / MOTTIV: Consider eating a sports gel or chews 20 minutes before start to boost blood sugar for the opening miles.

### Approach 2: Moderate Warmup

**Best for:** Intermediate half marathoners (1:30–2:00 goal), intermediate marathoners (3:10–3:30 goal), and anyone who feels noticeably better after a short jog but wants to stay conservative on fuel.

**Core principle:** A short jog and a few strides bridge the gap between rest and race pace without meaningfully depleting glycogen. The warmup should leave you feeling ready but not fatigued. *(Coolsaet, Humphrey, Sisson)*

**Sources:** Reid Coolsaet (Canadian Running), Luke Humphrey, Emily Sisson via Scott Douglas (Runner's World UK), LetsRun forum contributors

**Half Marathon protocol:**
| When | Action |
|---|---|
| 30–40 min before lining up | 10–15 min easy jog. Adjust for weather: more in cold, less in heat. *(LetsRun contributors)* |
| After jog | Dynamic stretching and/or form drills if desired |
| 10 min before start | 2–4 short strides. One LetsRun contributor suggests a single surge to goal pace for ~400m to lock in the feeling. |
| 15 min before start | Final bathroom stop *(Coolsaet, LetsRun)* |

**Marathon protocol (3:10–3:30 goal):**
| When | Action |
|---|---|
| 20 min before race | 3–5 min dynamic stretching |
| | 5–10 min light jog |
| | Get to line 5–10 min before start |
| | **Take a gel** to replace glycogen used during warmup *(Humphrey)* |

**Key takeaways:**
- Coolsaet: "You want to run enough before the race to hit your race pace off the start line. Five to 10 minutes of running and a few strides is plenty."
- Coolsaet: Many marathoners end up running at warmup pace for the first 5–10 minutes anyway. Going beyond a 10-minute warmup may prove counterproductive — you could regret it at the 40K mark.
- Coolsaet: Leave enough time between warmup and start for the porta-potty lines. GI issues 10K into the race are a nightmare.
- LetsRun tip: Use how long it takes you to settle into pace on easy runs as a guide for how much warmup you need on race day.
- Humphrey: If you jog before a marathon, **take a gel before the start** to replenish the glycogen you just burned.

### Approach 3: Full Competitive Warmup

**Best for:** Fast half marathoners (under 1:30), elite/sub-3:10 marathoners, Olympic Trials qualifiers, and runners whose race pace is significantly faster than their easy pace (75–90% VO2max).

**Core principle:** At these speeds, you need every system firing from the gun — the gap between resting and race intensity is too large to bridge with the first mile. This group needs the cardiovascular, neuromuscular, and metabolic priming that a thorough warmup provides. *(Humphrey, Sisson)*

**Sources:** Luke Humphrey, Emily Sisson via Scott Douglas (Runner's World UK)

**Half Marathon protocol:**
| Time Before Lining Up | Action |
|---|---|
| 50–60 min | Foam rolling or mobility work on trouble spots (plantar fascia, IT band). *(Sisson)* |
| 45 min | 1–3 mile warmup run: start at a jog, increase only as natural, finish near easy-day pace. Limit to 15 min if concerned about holding pace in final miles. *(Sisson)* |
| After run | 2–3 min form drills: A skips, high knees, butt kicks, side skips. *(Sisson)* |
| | 2–4 × 100m strides, gradually accelerating to slightly faster than half marathon pace. *(Sisson)* |
| 5 min before lining up | 30–60 sec at goal half marathon pace to lock in the feeling and prime the cardiovascular system. *(Sisson)* |

**Marathon protocol (sub-3:10):**
| Time Before Start | Action |
|---|---|
| 35–40 min | 3–5 min dynamic stretching |
| | 10 min light jog |
| | 3–5 min form drills |
| | 4–6 short strides |
| | Be on the line ~10 min before the gun |
| | **Take a gel** *(Humphrey)* |

**Sisson's marathon protocol:**
| Time Before Lining Up | Action |
|---|---|
| 40–50 min | 5 min dynamic flexibility exercises |
| | 1 mile or 10 min warmup run (whichever comes first): start at a jog, spend final 2 min at long run pace, final 90 sec progressively faster, last 30 sec at goal marathon pace. *(Sisson)* |
| | If 15+ min gap before lining up, do one more 30-sec run at goal marathon pace. *(Sisson)* |

**Key takeaways:**
- Humphrey: This group is trying to win races and qualify for Olympic Trials. They're at 75–90% VO2max from the gun and need every system primed.
- Sisson uses the same warmup for half marathons as she does for 10K races (she won the 2021 Olympic Trials 10,000m with this routine).
- Sisson's marathon warmup differs primarily in the length of the warmup run — shorter to conserve glycogen.
- For non-elite runners: Sisson's weekly mileage is likely higher than yours, so consider a slightly shorter warmup run than she prescribes. *(Runner's World UK editorial note)*

## Why Warming Up Still Matters at Longer Distances

Even though the warmup is less intense than for shorter races, it still serves important purposes:

**Injury prevention:** Dynamic stretching before a marathon promotes proper hip extension, reduces internal resistance, and could be critical to preventing muscle cramps late in the race — especially at mile 20+. The lunge matrix (developed by Gary Gray, popularized by Jay Johnson) is particularly effective. *(Coach Jeff)*

**Pacing control:** Using the first 1–2 miles as a warmup has a built-in benefit: it prevents you from starting too fast, which is the most common racing mistake at every distance. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV, Coolsaet)*

**Nervous system activation:** Even a short warmup stimulates the central nervous system, improves neural firing, and helps you settle into rhythm faster. *(Coach Jeff, Humphrey)*

**Physiological priming:** A warmup elevates muscle temperature (improving force-velocity relationships), raises baseline VO2, improves active range of motion, and increases motor neuron firing. The sweet spot for VO2 priming is 65–70% VO2max — a light to moderate run for most people. *(Humphrey)*

## Fueling & Nutrition

### Taper

| | Half Marathon | Marathon |
|---|---|---|
| Duration | 10–14 days *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)* | 2–3 weeks *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)* |
| Volume reduction | 40–60% less than normal | 40–50% less than normal |
| Workout character | Shorter runs, some short speed bursts | Shorter runs, some short speed bursts |
| Long run | Shorten significantly | Shorten significantly |

- Test race-day equipment (especially shoes) during taper workouts. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

### Carb Loading

| | Half Marathon | Marathon |
|---|---|---|
| Needed? | Yes, but moderate | Yes — essential |
| Strategy | Spread over a few meals. Biggest carb meal = breakfast the day before. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)* | Spread over 2–3 days and multiple meals. Biggest carb meal = breakfast the day before. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)* |
| Night-before dinner | Carb-centered, slightly larger than usual. Satisfied, not stuffed. | Same approach. Avoid new foods. |

Night-before dinner examples *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*:
- Lean burger + sweet potato fries
- Grilled salmon + rice + bread
- Normal-sized plate of pasta and meatballs

**Important:** A massive pre-race pasta dinner is *not* the best plan. Spreading carbs over multiple meals prevents bloating and sleep disruption. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

### Race Morning

- **Do not race on an empty stomach.** Eat a small, carb-focused breakfast **3–4 hours before the start** (marathon: at least 3 hours). *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
  - Bagel with almond butter and banana
  - Small bowl of oatmeal with berries
  - Toast with scrambled egg
- **20 minutes before start:** Consider a sports gel or chews to boost blood sugar for the opening miles. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Hydrate** with a light electrolyte drink between breakfast and start. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Coffee/tea drinkers:** follow your normal routine. Warm beverages help the GI system. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **If you jogged during warmup, take a gel before the start** to replenish burned glycogen. *(Humphrey)*

## Stretching Guidance

| Source | Approach |
|---|---|
| Coach Jeff | Dynamic stretching in the corral (lunge matrix, leg swings, ankle rolls, skipping drills). Under 5 min, minimal space. Practice this routine regularly — it will make you sore the first few times. |
| Humphrey | Dynamic stretching 10 min before start for slower runners. Full dynamic + form drills for faster runners. |
| Wendorff / MOTTIV | Dynamic stretching (leg swings, walking lunges) as an optional warmup element. |
| Sisson | Dynamic flexibility exercises + foam rolling on trouble spots before the warmup run. |

**Consensus:** Same as shorter races — dynamic stretching only. But at marathon distance, the lunge matrix and hip-focused dynamic stretches take on extra importance because they can help prevent late-race cramping and form breakdown. *(Coach Jeff, Humphrey)*

---

## Staying Warm Before the Start

Large half marathons and marathons often require arriving at the corral 30–60 minutes before the gun. Staying warm is critical — the warmer you stay, the less energy you burn shivering. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

**Strategies:**
- **Throwaway clothes:** Wear old sweatshirts, gloves, hats, or sweatpants you don't mind discarding. Toss them to the side of the road in the first mile or two. Most races collect discarded clothing for charity. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Thrift store layers:** Buy cheap warm clothes specifically for race morning. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Trash bag poncho:** Cut holes for head and arms in a large trash bag. Not stylish, but very effective. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Err on the side of too warm** rather than slightly cold. *(Coach Jeff)*

## Mental Preparation & Race Logistics

### Planning Ahead

For half marathons and especially marathons, detailed pre-race planning is more important than for shorter races. Several days before, sit down and plan: *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*

- **Travel logistics:** Parking, expo/registration times, distance from accommodations to start line.
- **Running gear checklist:** Outfit, accessories (handheld bottle), shoes, race nutrition. If traveling, make a packing list.
- **Food plan:** Pre-plan meals for the day before and race morning. Make restaurant reservations. Ensure you have all food/drinks you need.
- **Race morning schedule:** Wake-up time, breakfast time, departure time, warmup timeline.

### Race Morning Mindset

- **Wake up early.** Coach Jeff recommends 2.5 hours before the marathon — research shows it takes hours for body temperature to reach optimal levels. Waking early also allows time to fuel, use the bathroom, and do a shakeout run. *(Coach Jeff)*
- **Build routine familiarity.** As with shorter races, a practiced warmup routine calms nerves by shifting focus to something familiar. *(Coach Jeff, Sisson)*
- **Use pace groups.** Many large half marathons and marathons have volunteer pace group leaders who run at a steady pace for a target finish time. Line up near the group that matches your goal. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Start position:** Line up among runners targeting a similar time. Avoid the front unless you're elite — the "rabbits" will pull you out too fast. Line up on the same side as the first turn. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
- **Leave time for bathroom.** Between warmup and start, build in time for porta-potty lines. GI issues early in a long race are devastating. *(Coolsaet, Coach Jeff)*

## Half Marathon vs. Marathon: Key Differences

| Factor | Half Marathon | Marathon |
|---|---|---|
| Glycogen concern | Moderate — carb load over a few meals | High — carb load over 2–3 days |
| Taper duration | 10–14 days | 2–3 weeks |
| Warmup jog necessity | Helpful for most; optional for 2:00+ | Minimal for most; shakeout upon waking instead |
| Pre-start gel | Optional | Recommended, especially if you jogged |
| Using first miles as warmup | Good strategy for 2:00+ runners | Good strategy for 3:30+ runners |
| Throwaway clothes importance | Moderate (depends on race size/weather) | High (long corral waits common) |
| Race-day planning complexity | Moderate | High (travel, nutrition, gear checklists) |
| Warmup VO2 sweet spot | 65–70% VO2max *(Humphrey)* | Same, but most runners are already racing near this zone |

## How This Compares to 5K/10K Warmups

The warmup philosophy inverts as race distance increases:

| Principle | 5K/10K | Half Marathon | Marathon |
|---|---|---|---|
| Warmup intensity | As much as possible | Moderate — balance readiness with conservation | Minimal — conserve glycogen |
| Strides | Critical (4–8 reps) | Helpful (2–4 reps) | Optional (a few if time allows) |
| Warmup jog | 5–20+ min, always recommended | 5–15 min, depends on goal time | Shakeout upon waking; maybe 5–10 min at corral |
| Goal-pace running pre-race | 4 × 30 sec at race pace | 30–60 sec optional | 30 sec only for fast runners |
| Using first miles as warmup | Never — you can't afford the time | Acceptable for 2:00+ runners | Recommended for most runners |
| Glycogen concern | None | Moderate | High |
| Key risk of skipping warmup | Oxygen debt, poor positioning | Stiff start, pacing errors | Minimal risk for most runners |

## Universal Takeaways

1. **The faster your goal pace, the more warmup you need.** A sub-3:00 marathoner needs a full warmup; a 4:30 marathoner should save the energy. *(Humphrey)*
2. **For most half and full marathoners, the first 1–2 miles can serve as the warmup.** This conserves glycogen and prevents starting too fast. *(Coach Jeff, MOTTIV, Humphrey, Coolsaet)*
3. **Dynamic stretching is the one universal element** across all finish times and distances. Do it in the corral, even in tight spaces. *(Coach Jeff, Humphrey, Sisson)*
4. **If you jog before a marathon, take a gel before the start** to replace burned glycogen. *(Humphrey)*
5. **Stay warm in the corral.** Throwaway clothes, thrift store layers, or trash bag ponchos save energy that you'll need later. *(Coach Jeff, Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
6. **Carb load, but don't overdo it.** Spread carbs over multiple meals across 1–3 days. A massive pasta dinner the night before is counterproductive. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
7. **Wake up early on marathon day** — at least 2.5 hours before the start. Do a 10-min shakeout run, eat, and arrive stress-free. *(Coach Jeff)*
8. **Plan everything days in advance.** Travel, food, gear, schedule. The less you have to think about on race morning, the better you'll perform. *(Wendorff / MOTTIV)*
9. **Don't overdo the warmup.** Coolsaet: "Going beyond a 10-minute warmup may prove counterproductive — you could regret it at the 40K mark."
10. **Leave time for the bathroom** between warmup and start. GI issues early in a long race are devastating. *(Coolsaet, Coach Jeff)*
