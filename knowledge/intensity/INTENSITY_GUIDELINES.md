To optimize this data for **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, the information is structured with clear hierarchical headers, consistent terminology, and a combination of tables and list-based definitions. This allows an LLM to "chunk" the data effectively and retrieve specific mappings accurately.

# Training Intensity Mapping: HR vs. Zone vs. Effort

This guide provides the equivalence between Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), Training Zones, Heart Rate percentages, and racing terminology.

## Intensity Equivalence Table
| Effort Level (RPE 1-10) | Training Zone | Heart Rate (% of Max) | Quantitative Descriptor | Racing Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1/10** | Zone 1 | 50-60% | Very Easy / Active Recovery | Warm-up, Cool-down |
| **2/10** | Zone 1 | 55-60% | Easy / Recovery | Recovery between intervals |
| **3/10** | Zone 2 | 60-65% | Steady / Aerobic Base | Ultra-marathon, long slow distance |
| **4/10** | Zone 2 | 65-70% | Consistent / Moderate | Foundation training |
| **5/10** | Zone 3 | 70-75% | Moderate / Aerobic Power | Marathon pace |
| **6/10** | Zone 3 | 75-80% | Vigorous / Steady-State | Half-marathon pace |
| **7/10** | Zone 4 | 80-85% | Hard / Threshold | 10K to 15K race pace |
| **8/10** | Zone 4 | 85-90% | Very Hard / Lactate Threshold | 5K to 10K race pace |
| **9/10** | Zone 5 | 90-95% | Maximal / Anaerobic | 5K finish, Interval sprints |
| **10/10** | Zone 5 | 95-100% | All Out / Sprint | Final kick, 400m sprint |

## Detailed Level Definitions

### Recovery Intensity (RPE 1-2)
- **Zone:** Zone 1
- **Heart Rate:** 50% to 60% of Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)
- **Keywords:** Very Easy, Effortless, Light, Recovery.
- **Talk Test:** Can sing or speak in full, uninterrupted sentences.
- **Racing Context:** Used for flushing out lactic acid after a race or during warm-ups.

### Aerobic / Base Intensity (RPE 3-4)
- **Zone:** Zone 2
- **Heart Rate:** 60% to 70% of MHR
- **Keywords:** Steady, Consistent, Easy, Conversational, Base Pace.
- **Talk Test:** Can maintain a full conversation comfortably.
- **Racing Context:** The "all-day" pace used for Ultra-endurance events and Ironman-distance cycling/running.

### Tempo / Moderate Intensity (RPE 5-6)
- **Zone:** Zone 3
- **Heart Rate:** 70% to 80% of MHR
- **Keywords:** Moderate, Vigorous, Comfortably Hard, Aerobic Power.
- **Talk Test:** Can speak in short sentences, but breathing is more rhythmic and labored.
- **Racing Context:** Typical for Marathon distance or 70.3 (Half-Ironman) events.

### Threshold Intensity (RPE 7-8)
- **Zone:** Zone 4
- **Heart Rate:** 80% to 90% of MHR
- **Keywords:** Hard, Threshold, Labored, Controlled Discomfort.
- **Talk Test:** Can only speak in one- or two-word bursts.
- **Racing Context:** The maximum sustainable pace for 10K to Half-Marathon distances. Often called "Lactate Threshold."

### Maximal / Anaerobic Intensity (RPE 9-10)
- **Zone:** Zone 5
- **Heart Rate:** 90% to 100% of MHR
- **Keywords:** All Out, Sprint, Maximal, Anaerobic, Redline.
- **Talk Test:** Impossible to speak; gasping for air.
- **Racing Context:** Short intervals (400m-800m), 5K race finishes, and high-intensity hill sprints.

## Calculation Context (BPM Example)
To convert the percentages above into **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**, use an example **Max Heart Rate of 190 BPM**:
- **Zone 1 (60%):** 114 BPM
- **Zone 2 (70%):** 133 BPM
- **Zone 3 (80%):** 152 BPM
- **Zone 4 (90%):** 171 BPM
- **Zone 5 (100%):** 190 BPM
